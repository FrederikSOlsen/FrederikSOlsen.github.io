  This is an assigment for DTU in the course - 02806 and explores data visualization 
  and analysis. This website explores the San Francisco crime scene with focus on Narcotics and Drugs.
  As we'll get into in a bit we'll see that drug related crimes has decreased from the start of this dataset,
  the reason for this is what we'll explore but I can spoil you its due to legalization changes.
